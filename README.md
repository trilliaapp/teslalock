# TeslaLock

## About

TeslaLock is a standalone Watch App for Tesla.

This app is one of the few standalone watchOS apps for your Tesla vehicle. It is the perfect companion to the official Tesla app.

## Features

* **Quick**: Basic everyday actions, such as unlocking your car, can be done with a single tap from your wrist.
* **Efficient**: This app does not create any phantom drain (no background activity).
* **Secure**: Username and password are never stored nor sent to any third-party servers (other than Tesla’s own servers). To operate, the app stores a unique authentication token that is encrypted locally on the watch’s keychain. This token can be revoked manually at any moment.
* **Simple**: This app is built from the ground up to avoid clutter and focus only on the most essential functions.

## Disclaimer

This app is not endorsed by Tesla Inc. Use at your own risk. Only you are responsible for any changes made to your car by using the app.
